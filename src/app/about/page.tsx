              <p>
                Krimai was founded in 2023 by a team of AI researchers, engineers, and product designers who shared a common vision: to make advanced AI accessible and useful for everyday work.
              </p>
              <p>
                We recognized that while artificial intelligence was advancing rapidly, the tools available to most people weren't capturing the full potential of this technology. Many existing solutions were either too complex for non-technical users or too simplistic to be truly useful for professional work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our team set out to build something differentâ€”an AI assistant that combined sophisticated capabilities with an intuitive interface, making powerful AI accessible to everyone regardless of their technical background.
              </p>
              <p>
                After months of research and development, we launched Krimai with a commitment to continuous improvement and a focus on solving real problems for our users. Today, we're proud to serve thousands of professionals across various industries, helping them enhance their productivity, creativity, and capabilities.
